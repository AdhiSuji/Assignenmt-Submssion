This Online Assignment Submission System is a Django-based web application designed to streamline the process of assignment management between teachers and students. The platform enables teachers to create classes, assign tasks, check for plagiarism, and grade student submissions efficiently. Students can register using a unique Teacher Reference ID, join multiple classes, submit assignments, track their performance, and engage with teachers through a query system. The system features secure authentication, role-based access (Admin, Teacher, Student), real-time performance dashboards, and automated plagiarism checking. With a responsive design built on Bootstrap and a PostgreSQL backend, this project ensures scalability, ease of use, and a seamless user experience for educational institutions.
